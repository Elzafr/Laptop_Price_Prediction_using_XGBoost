# Laptop Price Modelling
# Overview
This repository contains Laptop Price Modelling using Extreme Gradient Boosting, to help determine the optimum laptop prize using Regression as main algorithm. The Python Script is Focused in main thing such : Data Understanding, Data Adjusment, Data insight via Visualization, Modelling, and Deployement Model.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis. The dataset includes information about Laptop Price Specfication and Factors, like a Model laptop, Brand, RAM, Storage, and Final Price.

scripts: This directory contains the Python scripts used for data Adjusment, Visualization, Modeling, and Evaluating.

notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step walkthroughs of the analysis process. These notebooks are named and organized by the specific analysis they cover.

# Data Visualization
The data visualization part of the analysis aims to provide insights into Laptop Price Prediction for Specific Criteria. Visualization techniques such as Histogram, bar charts, and Violin are used to see Price Distribution, Average Price of Brand, and Numerical Distribution. To explore the data visualization analysis, refer to the notebooks in the "notebooks".

# Final Price Prediction Modeling
Through countless iterations and rigorous testing, this XGBoost model emerges as a formidable force. It can predict laptop prices with remarkable precision, taking into account a myriad of features and the ever-shifting tides of the market.

# Model Evaluation
For evaluation, we used metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. These metrics help us understand how well the model predicts laptop prices compared to actual values.
Once the model was ready, we tested it with new input criteria, such as laptop model, CPU type, RAM size, etc. This allows us to get real-time price predictions for laptops based on user-specified criteria.
